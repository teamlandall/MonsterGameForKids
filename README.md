# MonsterGameForKids 

First program I built on my own using Ruby. 

Simple interactive program where we create a Monster that a user gets to name and then select from a series of behaviors. 

Once the selected behavior is ran, the user can decide to continue and select another behavior or end the game. 

Upon selecting to end the game they are given a scoreboard that recaps how many times each behavior was selected. 

Program starts by creating a class and uses specific methods for each behavior. Those behaviors are called in a case statement. 

Tried to make each behavior unique in some way utilizing different loop options or built in ruby methods where available. 

Chases and Hides could certainly be improved upon with some other sort of unique feature. 

Currently I am running this program off the command line, but a web interface would allow for a lot more fun interaction with a kid. Maybe that's V2.0. 

If you have any suggestions on how this program could be improved, code written cleaner or interesting options for new behaviors, I'd appreciate the feedback. 

Thanks,
